									<br/>
									<p>
										Thanks for wanting to know more. The truth is, should you have found this site somehow we wanted to have 
										something to show you.  Basically, we are stuck in a chicken and egg scenario. We need to publish on Bitcointalk 
										before we make the site live, however, we need the site live before we can publish on Bitcointalk. You can see 
										the position we have been put in.
									</p>
									<br/>
									<p>
										In order to ensure that our domain is propagated through the network, before we publish on Bitcointalk, we are forced to publish the site.
										If I'm truthful, I'm not sure how you found us, however, if you come back on Monday, June 11th, 2018 after 15:01 EST this link will send
										you to the appropriate page on Bitcointalk.
									</p>
									<br/>
									<p>
										Thanks for your patients, the Vlabs team. Saturday, June 9th, 2018 21:03 EST.
